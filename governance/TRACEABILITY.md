# AEGIS Platform Engineering Traceability Register

This register links authoritative engineering reviews, decisions, and implementation work orders. It records relationships between governed artifacts without replacing their canonical contents.

## Traceability Entries

### TR-001: Canonical Runtime Contract Hardening

**Status:** Closed
**Recorded:** 2026-07-28
**Closed:** 2026-07-29
**Subject:** Canonical runtime contract integrity improvements

| Sequence | Record | Relationship | Repository reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Original Architecture Review — Canonical Runtime Architecture | Approved the canonical runtime architecture and classified the remaining findings as implementation hardening tasks rather than architectural blockers. | Canonical repository location not recorded at the time of this entry. |
| 2 | Engineering Director Decision — Canonical Runtime Architecture Approval | Accepted the Architecture Review conclusion and authorized creation of the implementation work order. | Decision directive received 2026-07-28; canonical repository location not recorded at the time of this entry. |
| 3 | Implementation Work Order — Canonical Runtime Contract Hardening | Defines the authorized scope, exclusions, acceptance criteria, deliverables, verification requirements, and final closure evidence for the accepted hardening work. | [`work-orders/WO-002_CANONICAL_RUNTIME_CONTRACT_HARDENING.md`](work-orders/WO-002_CANONICAL_RUNTIME_CONTRACT_HARDENING.md) |

**Implementation authority:** Work was authorized only within the scope of `WO-002`. The approved architecture remained an upstream constraint and was not reopened by this traceability entry.

#### Closure Evidence

| Evidence | Reference or recorded outcome |
|---|---|
| Approved implementation HEAD | `7d2ca3a5177bcc14f6459c71857e231abb4d568f` |
| Contract enforcement commit | `48193e1b6994300c37cfae81bfc36d0d4854de7f` |
| Final state-gap closure commit | `7d2ca3a5177bcc14f6459c71857e231abb4d568f` |
| Focused QA | `47 passed` |
| Full suite | `125 passed` |
| Static validation | Ruff lint passed; Ruff format check passed; `git diff --check` passed |
| Regression result | No functional regressions found |
| QA observation | One non-failing local `.pytest_cache` warning |
| QA & Verification verdict | **PASS WITH OBSERVATIONS** |
| Architecture Auditor verdict | **APPROVE** |
| Documentation & Governance status | **CLOSED** |

The authoritative acceptance and scope results are recorded in the [WO-002 closure record](work-orders/WO-002_CANONICAL_RUNTIME_CONTRACT_HARDENING.md#closure-record). All required evidence references are identified, and no unresolved blocking findings remain.

#### Authorization Boundary After Closure

The next approved Phase I convergence direction is recorded, without implementation authorization, as:

```text
main
→ Kernel
→ explicit legacy compatibility adapter
→ canonical CognitiveRuntime
```

This direction is outside WO-002. Current post-HEAD execution-conformance work appears to be a separate slice and must remain under a separate authorization boundary. No new work order was opened as part of WO-002 closure.
